            <p>The Second World War was very bloody. Almost 300,000 USA service men were killed.
                </br> 80 million people died in World War II.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 2 Hitlers Speech</h2>
            <p>
                Hitler says, “My German, men and women, changes of government have occurred.</br>
                Frequent attended so far-reaching results as that eight years ago.</br>
                At that time the Reich was desperate….”
            </p>
            <h2>Chapter 3 Hitler’s Blunders</h2>
            <p>In 1941 Hitler invaded Russia. </br>
                He thought Russia had only 200 regiments, but they identified more than 300. </br>
                Hitler almost won, but the Red Army stopped him in the Suburbs of Moscow, just in view or the Kremlin. </br>
                Now the Germans fought against the heavy Russian snow. </br>
                Hitlers other blunder was to declare war on the US. </br>
                When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor the Americans used it as a lever to join the European War.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 4 D-DAY</h2>
            <p> On June 6, 1944 more than 160,000 Allied troops landed along 50 miles of heavily fortified French coastline to fight the Germans on the beaches.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 5 The Long War is Over!</h2>
            <p> The Nazis were pushed back into Germany. </br>
                Hitler killed himself and gave command over to Grand Admiral Burnitz.
                </br> Durnitz surrendered to the Allies that month. The War was over! America won the War!
